I have been working with sensors and modelling them with neural networks. There are many challenges with this approach to sensor modelling but I think racing drones can benefit much from this approach. More importantly, drone racing, which requires high performing algorithms, is an application that can leverage the work I have been doing in the past.

Drone racing is a natural intersection with my current research on path planning algorithms. Both effective obstacle avoidance and time considered algorithms, which are latent issues in drone racing, are of my interest. There are several ideas from mobile robots that prove effect for drone racing.

I make research in multi robot path planning. Just like with humans, I think robots that collaborate can do much more than robots that work independently. Although at this stage, for Alpha Pilot AI Challenge robots are not collaborating, it can be a great platform for future race formats in which drones race as teams, and their success depends not only on their speed, but also their ability to work together.

I like the Alpha Pilot AI challenge because its about speed. Current localization and mapping algorithms are proven for robots moving at limited speeds. But I find exciting to test them at the maximum speed a drone can fly. I foresee it is a challenging problem but also one that will require new techniques to be developed and thus advance the state of the art. This is what excites me.

The reason why I wanted to participate in Alpha AI challenge is because it is putting at the forefront all the challenges with autonomous robots. Particularly the safety aspect of autonomous robots. Just like autonomous cars, human-piloted drones could be thought of as "safe", since are piloted by humans, and autonomous drones can be considered as "unsafe" since are piloted by very limited algorithms. I consider this challenge to be an excellent tool to understand how this ideas are applied to drones and what is possible now.
